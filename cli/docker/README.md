# Using the Hookdeck CLI with Docker

This quickstart demonstrates how to use the Hookdeck CLI from Docker.

It includes ensuring that a Hookdeck [Connection](https://hookdeck.com/docs/connections?ref=github-quickstarts-cli-docker)
(a [Source](https://hookdeck.com/docs/sources?ref=github-quickstarts-cli-docker) and a [Destination](https://hookdeck.com/docs/destinations?ref=github-quickstarts-cli-docker))
exists by running a cURL command from the container.

To receive events within the docker contains, you also need to add your own web server.

## Before you begin

You'll need:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed
- A [Hookdeck account](https://dashboard.hookdeck.com/signup?ref=github-quickstarts-cli-docker)

## Set up

Copy the example `.env.example` file:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Set `HOOKDECK_API_KEY` to the value of your Project API key, which is found in the [secrets settings](https://dashboard.hookdeck.com/settings/project/secrets).

Set `HOOKDECK_SOURCE_NAME` to the name of your source. If this source does not exist, it will be created.

Set `APP_SERVICE_PORT` to the port of the application running in the Docker container.

## Run

```sh
docker-compose up
```


You will see output similar to the following:

```sh
docker-compose up

Requests to the **Event URL** from the CLI output will be forwarded to an application running on the port identified by `APP_SERVICE_PORT`. You will need to create this application.
